99PV,"My daughter enjoys this as a way to memorize her multiplication facts, something she has struggled with for 2 years. While it does give ample practice, she is allowed to move on to harder and harder levels regardless of her accuracy. As an example, she was moved through to completing 3rd grade multiplication even though her accuracy was only 54%. I would say that it’s imperative to require more accuracy than a guess. I cannot find any way to reset progress. The only thing I can do is create a new profile every couple of days. It’s annoying and I won’t be paying for another month. Also, when I try to create a 3rd profile, something the app claims I can do, I’m led to the payment screen again. I already paid for access for 3 profiles. I wish this app had more parental control or at least accuracy requirements."

24GB,I wish the rewards would time-out so I knew my kids were doing math and not just playing the whole time.  I also wish they had to pass or test out of a grade level before going on to the next one (or at least that that was an option in settings.)

55HO,Purchased in another splash math app. Your system is needlessly confusing. Requiring 50 characters is bad UX design and you should make a better choice. 
61CF,Was not interested in the app at this time. We will look into purchasing at a later date.
23UP,We are not interrsted in purchasing the app at this time. We may look into this at a later date.
90JM,I am not interested in splash math at this time. We may try again at a later date.
43CB,My child hates the app.
11RB,The subscription price is too high.
79NR,Did not interest my daughter at this time. She played for only a short few minutes each time. She didnt even play half of the free week. Maybe if things would have sparked her interest things would have resulted differently. Or maybe its just not the right time for her to take full advantage of a full subscription. We will try again when she is more excited about math. 
24SQ, My daughter did not find this interesting and did not use it often enough in the weeks time for me to see it worth subscribing for at this time maybe sometime again we will try it and it will be beneficial and worth paying for
16EF,. At this time the game is not beneficial to foresee paying a monthly subscription fee. My daughter has got very little use out of it in the last week because it does not peak her interest. Maybe as her math skills get better and she enjoys doing math more this might be beneficial and be interesting to her at that point.
99PB,My daughter is not interested in the math game. I dont feel it is beneficial at this time to purchase. Maybe as time goes by she will gain more of an interest and we can try again. Its just not for us at this time. 
81JG,My daughter is getting ready to start school for the new year and really has no interest in this nath practice game. 
71UN,"My daughter has shown very little interest in this math practice game. Also, she is getting ready to start the new school year and i dont see it bring beneficial at this time. "

69AI,Too expensive my kids does not play this game and there is nk use having it on my phone 
51FJ,"Daughter tried playing and gets ""loading"" and nothing else.  This is clearly a scam as 50 char to cancel is dishonest at best."
95FY,"We did not authorize a year subscription, our child did.\n"
78NG,"This app is good, just too expensive. There are other apps that offer the same thing for cheaper"
72VP,"The app itself is good however, there are other apps that are t as expensive."
27TA,Too expensive. Don't want to pay $80 upfront. Why is it requiring me to put in 50 characters??? \n
72PV,Child didnt like app. Said content was not adequate.
21AV,"I loke the program, but recommend you make it cheaper. I would love of see my daughter continue to use this program,  but i feel as though I can get an equal amount of benefit out of $1 flashcards. I do see that using the app saves me some time as a busy parent, and there is a monetary benefit to that, but in my opinion, it doesn’t outseigh the amoun that is charged for monthly use of this application. That’s just my opinion and I hope you understand why I am requesting to cancel my subscription. I do, however, find it ridiculous that you require a 50 word description of why I would like to cancel my subscription.  It has been nice, however, to voice my opinion and I hope you’ve valued it!  So, at this point, I’m sure I’ve rambled enough about why I’m canceling my subscription, but in case you want to know more... my daughter didnt acutally use this app much. She really wanted to try something new while we were on a roadtrip. We were both bored, and she likes math, so i thought i’d let her try it on my phone. I dont usually let her play on my phone, so thats another reason why I would like to discontinue my subscription. I think I’m probably at 100+ words now, so I think I’ve met the requirement. Thank you for your interest in my opinion!"
53SZ,My daughter get tired of the same thing over and over again

I would have been happy to pay for a reasonable monthly subscription that you could cancel at anytime. She may only need this for a short duration, then be ready to move on to something more challenging, so signing up for an entire year isn't reasonable at all."

73JP,Even though the game is very educational for my child. I feel like he shouldn't be on the app too long because technology has created a barrier for kids to communicate and learn the old fashion way.

31OE,"I would have kept this program if I could have kept him on one digit and two digit multiplication tables this summer.  The program moved him on from that and had him estimating to the nearest 100 and other tasks.  I understand that these are skills that are very needed and useful, but as a parent, I would have preferred an email suggesting he move on to another skill and I chose.  He still needs a lot of practice with his 6,7, and 8 multiplication tables before conquering estimation problems...that only frustrated him. You are almost there with this product though, with a bit more tweaking you will have a great product. "

12RZ,I do not like that there are not just straight math equations for them to solve. When you go into the addition area it shows pictures to match up with addition sentences. This is for second grade. They do not need pictures to add anymore. I would've liked it if it were just equations to solve￼

45KV,"Just dont want it anymore. I have to keep typing, I guess. Usually when you don’t want to pay for something you just say “hey, I’m not paying for this!” But i have to sit here and thumb in a bunch of stuff while this stupid music is playing because you need 50 characters, or you will take my money whether I want you to or not. This is certainly over 50 characters, but I think we are past that point now, don’t you Carl? You mind if I call you Carl? Well, Carl, here’s the thing, I deal with lazy teens all day, I got a bad hemorrhoid, and this growth on my right toe that just wont go away. All I want is to quit some math software I tried for my son so maybe he could practice, but he wasn’t keen to it. Now I have to type to you WHY I didn’t like the program before I can keep my hard earned money, money I had to earn by being around teenagers, the dirtiest known creature, during flu season? You know we had an impetigo outbreak last year? I have an infant son, that was close, my deoderant was Lysol for like a month. You guys are officially harder to get rid of than Jehovah’s Witnesses, all I do when they come to my door is show up in my underwear. That sends them running, let me tell you. Well, Carl, I can’t stand this music anymore and I really just want to go play video games. It’s been good, I guess."

39WH,The subscription price is too high.
77SG,it is a good app. i like it. but it is too difficult to my kid because he is three years old
52SQ, First off this is super hard to cancel. I have to write a minimum of 50 characters on why I want to cancel? That is ridiculous I should be allowed to just cancel. This app is not good. It's still uses pictures for first and second graders to count when they're adding. They are able to add without pictures and I think it is detrimental to them to continue providing pictures for them to count instead of actually calculating the equation. But really I'm still just typing because it won't let me cancel without 50 characters are more.
40LJ,Please stop this. This is enough please stop enough enough enough
89ED,Just don't want to get charged again... live the app but no more charges thanx. I have screen shot this so I have proof as well

It would be great if the app followed common core curriculum since that is what they follow in school.  It was also too easy for them to play the games.  Great incentive but need to challenge them more before they can play a game.

95WC,Kids not using the application on a daily basis so canceling the subscription 
29XV,"This fifty character minimum is ridiculous. I just need to cancel! This is insane. Are you so insecure that you must require this from potential customers that you could not persuade to invest in your product? Seems sketchy and scammy, like you are intentionally making it difficult to cancel. As if you expect this to deter us from canceling and will just let you keep charging our cards for a product we do not want. I don’t like this I’ve been trying to cancel the subscription for 15 minutes now. Do not want. This app is not worth seven dollars per month. It’s just not. I’m not impressed and do not wish to subscribe the cost is ridiculous and this cancellation method is ridiculous. There are apps that are much better that offer more dimension and gameplay that cost less or are free. There’s absolutely no justification for this price or this ridiculous 50 character minimum. Just cancel for the love of God."

This minimum, I cannot get over it, what the heck? "

14FM,I can't afford any paid products right now.
49GE,She was not very interested in the app and as a result I couldn’t motivate her to do her lessons without convincing her. Also the money section of the app did not apply to us as we don’t live in America. I wanted to find her a maths app that she could use independently however it seems that when using this one she still needed my assistance.
23LF, She did not find the app fun and she was disappointed that she could not use the money section of the app as we don't live in the United States and don't have pennies and quarters etc. She needed coaxing to complete the app and I felt that if it were something she really enjoyed doing she would not need convincing. I think the idea of 'trialling' the app is great.

33UC,"Daughter didn't like the formatting of the ""games"". Also, requiring the ability to read phrases such as ""greater than"" and ""less than"" at the kindergarten level just shows ignorance in the programming for this age group.

Also, she really struggled with this app due to confusion with what was being asked at times. My other children were able to do it, but understood her struggle.

75WX,The app is too expensive. Though it offers a great selection of activities for any age and I was using it for school purposes I'm already working on a teachers salary while paying for my own classroom activities. If this was cheaper or maybe had a discount for teachers exclusively I would be interested in continuing with the subscription. I just can't justify the money for it at this time. However I think it was developed to meet age-appropriate levels of education and I throughout enjoyed using the free trial with my students. I hope to get to use this app again in the future with more of my students. 
89SI,No longer needed. Blah blah nlah. Seriously ?  This is a poor app to require this.

42YG,Ordered in error please cancel as was not intending to purchase 
72UY,This app was being auto renewed with no notification to the parent who approved the initial purchase.  This account is set up as a family group with app sharing and requires parental approval...however the auto renew feature does not inform the parent or provide for the opportunity to resubscribe or cancel.  The monthly email alert only goes to the child’s email rather than another email to the parent or authorized member for purchases.  The child deleted the app many moths ago and wasn’t even aware that they had a subscription.  We feel very mislead and are not interested in continuing.  We are also discussing with apple directly and would like a refund from the time the app was deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n

65VH,My kid just turned 4 and the math is too simple yet you are expecting them to read at a grade 1-2 level.  He can do addition subtraction and simple multiplication but he cant read yet.  why would you introduce reading in a math app?  He could probably do all the grade 1 math and maybe grade 2 since it is so simple but he cant read yet.

In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state's ideology to Marxism–Leninism (which he created), and initiated a centrally planned economy. As a result, the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. Political paranoia was also fomented around Stalin, and the Great Purge was carried out to remove his opponents from the Communist Party through arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people."

69WE,"Splash math is too difficult for my four year old to do independently. She cannot read, so we had the questions read aloud. However, you do not allow the option of reading the answer choices aloud. This is needed for some types of questions. "
64QE,Good app.  I like the variety of tasks.  Third grade math does ramp up to quickly.  Child’s voice is appealing.  Error sound is not too harsh.  Reward games are good for younger kids.  
37CT,Good program.  I like the variety.  Child’s voice is engaging for my child. The multiplication in 3rd grade seems to ramp up quickly.  The animations are short & sweet and the correction/error voice isn’t harsh.
27XR, Splash math program needs to improve on how they were the directions. My daughter didn’t understand a lot of the stuff. All of the math problem addition and subtraction have the answers in the problem she just had to fill in the blank and that’s not what they do at school. I think it should follow the school curriculum that she’s learning. And telling time it should be more focused on the clock and what time it is instead of what does quarter past and quarter til mean.
39KF,I did Not like this program. I think it’s of all the school curriculum and it does not. Addition and subtraction problems have the answer right there in front of her she did not understand the directions and the clock section is stupid. It is not what she’s learning in school. 
27JM, The splash math program does not have very good directions. My daughter did not understand a lot of it. The addition and subtraction problems have the answer in the problem where all you have to do is fill in the blank. It does not follow school curriculum. The clock section should focus more on what time it is instead of what does quarter past and quarter till mean.
97GT,Sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks suck suck suck suck sick suck suck suck suck
51FG,I would like it to follow school standards. All the problems had the answers in the problem and when they were answered correctly it should say the right answer outloud. The time should focus more on the clock and what the time is instead of what does quarter past and quarter til means.

88NK,There needs to be some practice problems and instruction prior to each new concept. My daughter sometimes got new content that she did not know how to do and some practice and instruction would have been great! 
24YA,Make a practice problem before the problems. Some of the concepts were new to my daughter and she didn’t know how to do them.

I ask for help at that time, and got a reply that was unclear and just left me confused. I’m trying again. I want to cancel my subscription. Your instructions send me to settings on my iPhone. When I’m there, I can find Splash math subscription, but when I touch the one-year option, which are instructions tell me to do, all I get is a chance to buy another year. There is no option to delete or cancel."
95XO," This is the third time I have gone through this process and field in this information. And, I imagine it it’s going to be another total fail. I want to cancel because my granddaughter hates it. She won’t use it. And I never meant to purchase it in the first place. And your instructions for canceling our wrong. I can fine “splash math“ in my subscriptions list on my iPhone, but there is absolutely No way that I can cancel by “touching the subscription I have” (meaning, the one year choice). My only choice is to buy another year."
44PR," I never wanted to subscribe to the app. I read that I could try it for a week, and when I try to do that, I found it so confusing that I ended up with the one your purchase. My granddaughter NEVER uses this app and I don’t want it. What’s more, I have been trying to follow your instructions to cancel my subscription and they don’t work. When I get to splash math in my subscriptions in settings,My only choice is to subscribe for another year. There is no response that indicates I can cancel."

49MJ,"The price of the app is a little expensive. Though the games are helpful and interactive for my child. I would  consider buying the app if the yearly wasn't $75.00. If there was a different option for the subscription, I would be more inclined to keep this app. Please consider having different subscription option. My child thoroughly enjoyed the free trial and she has definitely gained confidence. However, there are numerous apps out there that is less expensive. Perhaps consider offering only parts of the app of all. \nWhile I like that you guys offer a free seven day trial, I don't like how you have to write a novel to cancel this subscription. Makes people not want to use it again. In fact it leaves a bad taste, the fact that I just can't cancel with a press of a button. \n"

23EV,We are not using it as often as I was hoping.  What I don't like is the child is able to change the grade of math they are using.  I found my son working on a lower grade to get cones to play the video game attached.   Otherwise I like the app but won't be spending the money\n\nWhy do I need to write min 50 characters in order to cancel my membership.  I've mentioned why I am cancelling.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

84ZN,She finished the third grade section with no progress the fourth grade session doesn’t make sense and it’s not worth the money.  The fact that you have a 50 character minimum here is foolish:  just cancel the subscription.\n................................................

65NZ,"While it does seem like a good game, my child ended up not using it as much as I would like for the cost of a monthly subscription. If this would have been a one time cost, I wouldn’t mind, but paying 10 monthly for a game he hasn’t played since we downloaded , is kind of wasting money."
