43MB,Ignore,This app was being auto renewed with no notification to the parent who approved the initial purchase.  This account is set up as a family group with app sharing and requires parental approval...however the auto renew feature does not inform the parent or provide for the opportunity to resubscribe or cancel.  The monthly email alert only goes to the child’s email rather than another email to the parent or authorized member for purchases.  The child deleted the app many moths ago and wasn’t even aware that they had a subscription.  We feel very mislead and are not interested in continuing.  We are also discussing with apple directly and would like a refund from the time the app was deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n
